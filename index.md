**[No Honk](https://www.nohonk.org)** is a social initiative for self and environmental peace! 

## How

You can use this theme with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) or you can simply use it with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).
For local usage just download [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), use installation guide for more. You can download latest Biscuit from [its Github repository](https://github.com/sblisesivdin/biscuit).

If you prefer to use Github Pages, you do not need to download it, upload files to a new repository...etc., just [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-starter/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and use it.

## Why

* `_config.yml`            : Main configuration file.
* `index.md`               : Website page (for now, this page).
* `_includes/head.html`    : File to add custom code to `<head>` section.
* `_includes/scripts.html` : File to add custom code before `</body>`. You can change footer at here.
